  "Description": "With the release of 7.0 SquareEnix has implemented several temporal antialiasing solutions. However they all have a severe bug that affects image quality significantly.\nThis plugin will restore using jitter when talking to NPCs or in cutscenes and gpose. Jitter (not noticeable micromovements of the camera) is necessary for temporal antialiasing solutions (DLSS, DLAA, TSCMAA+jitter) to work properly.\nFor some reason, SquareEnix decided we don't need jitter during the time where the game benefits from using it the most.",
