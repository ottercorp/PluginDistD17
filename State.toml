These new colors are part of your color profile. (By [Bloodsoul](https://github.com/Bloodsoul))\n- Durability & Spiritbond widget: Added options to specify how both durability and spiritbond values should be calculated and displayed. Available options are: Minimum, Average and Maximum. The default values are set to the original implementation. (by [alexpado](https://github.com/alexpado)).\n- Durability & Spiritbond widget: Added options to show progress bars instead of values. (by [alexpado](https://github.com/alexpado))\n- Dynamic Menu widget: Add the ability to set a label on separators. You can now right-click a separator and click \"Configure\" to open a window in which you can set a label.\n- Gearset Switcher widget: Added an option to change the visual theme of the buttons in the popup header. (by [alexpado](https://github.com/alexpado))\n- Widget settings: Added a button to clear all widgets from a column in the toolbar widget's panel in Umbra's settings window. (by [alexpado](https://github.com/alexpado))\n\n## Fixes & Improvements\n\n- Dynamic Menu Widget: Show custom menu name in the widgets configurator column in Umbra's settings window to make multiple instances of this type more distinguishable from one another. (by [alexpado](https://github.com/alexpado))\n- Fixed a crash that occurred when restarting umbra from the settings window.\n\nJoin [Umbra's Discord server](https://discord.gg/xaEnsuAhmm) for the latest updates and information.\nVisit the [website](https://una-xiv.github.io/umbra-docs/) for more information and guides on how to make the most out of Umbra.\n"
