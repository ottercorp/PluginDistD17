(This will not include headers)\n\n## UI Changes:\n* Open Scratch Pads in the ScratchPads tab of the Settings UI now has a minimum size. (See bug fixes 1)\n* Added a `Show Advanced Settings` option to the settings page to hide and show the more advanced settings of the plugin.\n* The `Bug?` button in Settings will now show a message box that gives the user an idea of what kind information to include in a bug report.\n* The `Bug?` button in Settings has been renamed to `Found A Bug?`\n* Added a tooltip to the `Buy Me A Ko-Fi` button that explains the nature of the button.\n* Redesigned the `Replace Text Suggestions` list\n\n## Bugs Fixed:\n1. The height of the `Open Scratch Pads` section in the ScratchPads tab of the Settings UI could become 0 if there was no room left in the window.\n2. Major performance loss with large text entries.\n3. Right clicking on the `Replace Text` input field would cause word wrapping to temporarily break.\n\n## Technical Stuff:\n* PadState class has been moved to the DataTypes.cs file\n* Added more error reporting in an attempt to catch a bug that was reported.\n* Adjusted the way UI is drawn in the ScratchPad (Switching away from tables. No visual difference should be noticeable)\n* Removed some unnecessary `if` statements from the saving settings process.\n* There was a minor calculation issue in the way text was displayed that was causing a massive drop in performance. By changing the way the calculation is handled I was able to bring massive performance gains to Wordsmith. I sincerely apologize to everyone for any performance issues they may have experienced with Wordsmith until this point."

The solution was to unwrap the string.\n  * Contractions were counted as spelling errors because the text was used in spellchecking not the Regex match value.\n  * Adding words to dictionary was not unwrapping the string first leading to unwanted behaviors.\n  * Found an issue with calculating where to split the chunks that could lead to not breaking on a sentence terminator when one is available and managed to fix it.\n  * Found an issue where deleting a thesaurus item could cause an error dump due to a modified collection exception.\n  * Found an infinite loop in `Copy Text To Clipboard`."

The solution was to unwrap the string.\n  * Contractions were counted as spelling errors because the text was used in spellchecking not the Regex match value.\n  * Adding words to dictionary was not unwrapping the string first leading to unwanted behaviors.\n  * Found an issue with calculating where to split the chunks that could lead to not breaking on a sentence terminator when one is available and managed to fix it.\n  * Found an issue where deleting a thesaurus item could cause an error dump due to a modified collection exception.\n  * Found an infinite loop in `Copy Text To Clipboard`."

This will allow for the plugin to see you own the house and add it to your 'Characters' list.\n- Once the house is registered due to the way the inventory data of each section is provided, you must enter each section to have it be parsed by the plugin. For Indoor and Outdoor Furnishings you must enter the storeroom tab before that data is collected.\n- For Interior Fixtures open the relevant section in the housing menu.\n- There's a lot of moving parts so if you run into issues, bugs or crashes hit up the #plugin-help-forum on discord.\n- I'll be working on making the 'Is Housing Item' filter a bit more reliable as this might be more important now.\n"

changelog = "**One of the last pre-releases before moving to a full stable release** \n\n**New Features**\n\n- The 'Nearby Players' list is now sorted alphabetically by default.\n- New configuration options have been added:\n\t* 'Show known players first': display friends, party members & other known players on the top of the list\n\n**Improvements**\n\n- The 'Nearby Players' list will now sort by distance when finding players nearby to you. In practice, this means that when you've set the 'max players shown' to lower than the current nearby players, the people closest to you will be shown first.\n\n**Translation Updates**\n\n- German translation updates\n"
