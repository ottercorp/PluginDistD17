(Can be disabled in settings.)\n* By default, when the target posts a message while the Snooper window is visible, a sound alert is now played. (Can be disabled in settings.)"

(This will not include headers)\n\n## UI Changes:\n* Open Scratch Pads in the ScratchPads tab of the Settings UI now has a minimum size. (See bug fixes 1)\n* Added a `Show Advanced Settings` option to the settings page to hide and show the more advanced settings of the plugin.\n* The `Bug?` button in Settings will now show a message box that gives the user an idea of what kind information to include in a bug report.\n* The `Bug?` button in Settings has been renamed to `Found A Bug?`\n* Added a tooltip to the `Buy Me A Ko-Fi` button that explains the nature of the button.\n* Redesigned the `Replace Text Suggestions` list\n\n## Bugs Fixed:\n1. The height of the `Open Scratch Pads` section in the ScratchPads tab of the Settings UI could become 0 if there was no room left in the window.\n2. Major performance loss with large text entries.\n3. Right clicking on the `Replace Text` input field would cause word wrapping to temporarily break.\n\n## Technical Stuff:\n* PadState class has been moved to the DataTypes.cs file\n* Added more error reporting in an attempt to catch a bug that was reported.\n* Adjusted the way UI is drawn in the ScratchPad (Switching away from tables. No visual difference should be noticeable)\n* Removed some unnecessary `if` statements from the saving settings process.\n* There was a minor calculation issue in the way text was displayed that was causing a massive drop in performance. By changing the way the calculation is handled I was able to bring massive performance gains to Wordsmith. I sincerely apologize to everyone for any performance issues they may have experienced with Wordsmith until this point."

The solution was to unwrap the string.\n  * Contractions were counted as spelling errors because the text was used in spellchecking not the Regex match value.\n  * Adding words to dictionary was not unwrapping the string first leading to unwanted behaviors.\n  * Found an issue with calculating where to split the chunks that could lead to not breaking on a sentence terminator when one is available and managed to fix it.\n  * Found an issue where deleting a thesaurus item could cause an error dump due to a modified collection exception.\n  * Found an infinite loop in `Copy Text To Clipboard`."
